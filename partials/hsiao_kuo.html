<h3>The Judgement</h3>
<p>Preponderance of the Small. Success.
<br />
Perseverance furthers.
<br />
Small things may be done; great things should not be done.
<br />
The flying bird brings the message:
<br />
It is not well to strive upward,
<br />
It is well to remain below.
<br />
Great good fortune.
</p>
