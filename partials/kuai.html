<h3>The Judgement</h3>
<p>Break-through. One must resolutely make the matter known
<br />
At the court of the king.
<br />
It must be announced truthfully. Danger.
<br />
It is necessary to notify one's own city.
<br />
It does not further to resort to arms.
<br />
It furthers one to undertake something.
</p>
<h3>The Image</h3>
<p>The lake has risen up to heaven:
<br />
The image of Break-through.
<br />
Thus the superior man
<br />
Dispenses riches downward
<br />
And refrains from resting on his virtue.
</p>
<h3>The Lines</h3>
<p><i>Nine at the beginning means:</i>
<br />
Mighty in the forward-striding toes.
<br />
When one goes and is not equal to the task,
<br />
One makes a mistake.
</p>
<p><i>Nine in the second place means:</i>
<br />
A cry of alarm. Arms at evening and at night.
<br />
Fear nothing.
</p>
<p><i>Nine in the third place means:</i>
<br />
To be powerful in the cheekbones
<br />
Brings misfortune.
<br />
The superior man is firmly resolved.
<br />
He walks alone and is caught in the rain.
<br />
He is bespattered,
<br />
And people murmur against him.
<br />
No blame.
</p>
<p><i>Nine in the fourth place means:</i>
<br />
There is no skin on his thighs,
<br />
And walking comes hard.
<br />
If a man were to let himself be led like a sheep,
<br />
Remorse would disappear.
<br />
But if these words are heard
<br />
They will not be believed.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Nine in the fifth place means:</i>
<br />
In dealing with weeds,
<br />
Firm resolution is necessary.
<br />
Walking in the middle
<br />
Remains free of blame.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Six at the top means:</i>
<br />
No cry.
<br />
In the end misfortune comes.
</p>
