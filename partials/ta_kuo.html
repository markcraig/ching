<h3>The Judgement</h3>
<p>Preponderance of the Great.
<br />
The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.
<br />
It furthers one to have somewhere to go.
<br />
Success.
</p>
<h3>The Image</h3>
<p>The lake rises above the trees:
<br />
The image of Preponderance of the Great.
<br />
Thus the superior man, when he stands alone,
<br />
Is unconcerned,
<br />
And if he has to renounce the world,
<br />
He is undaunted.
</p>
<h3>The Lines</h3>

<br />
A dry poplar sprouts at the root.
<br />
An older man takes a young wife.
<br />
Everything furthers.
</p>
<p><i>Nine in the third place means:</i>
<br />
The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.
<br />
Misfortune.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Nine in the fourth place means:</i>
<br />
The ridgepole is braced. Good fortune.
<br />
If there are ulterior motives, it is humiliating.
</p>
<p><i>Nine in the fifth place means:</i>
<br />
A withered poplar puts forth flowers.
<br />
An older woman takes a husband.
<br />
No blame. No praise.

One must go through the water.

It goes over one's head.
<br />
Misfortune. No blame.
</p>
