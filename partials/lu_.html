<h3>The Judgement</h3>
<p>The Wanderer. Success through smallness.
<br />
Perseverance brings good fortune
<br />
To the wanderer.
</p>
<h3>The Image</h3>
<p>Fire on the mountain:
<br />
The image of The Wanderer.
<br />
Thus the superior man
<br />
Is clear-minded and cautious
<br />
In imposing penalties,
<br />
And protracts no lawsuits.
</p>
<h3>The Lines</h3>
<p><i>Six at the beginning means:</i>
<br />
If the wanderer busies himself with trivial things,
<br />
He draws down misfortune upon himself.
</p>
<p><i>Six in the second place means:</i>
<br />
The wanderer comes to an inn.
<br />
He has his property with him.
<br />
He wins the steadfastness of a young servant.
</p>
<p><i>Nine in the third place means:</i>
<br />
The wanderer's inn burns down.
<br />
He loses the steadfastness of his young servant.
<br />
Danger.
</p>
<p><i>Nine in the fourth place means:</i>
<br />
The wanderer rests in a shelter.
<br />
He obtains his property and an ax.
<br />
My heart is not glad.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Six in the fifth place means:</i>
<br />
He shoots a pheasant.
<br />
It drops with the first arrow.
<br />
In the end this brings both praise and office.
</p>
<p><i>Nine at the top means:</i>
<br />
The bird's nest burns up.
<br />
The wanderer laughs at first,
<br />
Then must needs lament and weep.
<br />
Through carelessness he loses his cow.
<br />
Misfortune.
</p>
