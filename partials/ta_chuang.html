<h3>The Judgement</h3>
<p>The Power of the Great. Perseverance furthers.
</p>
<h3>The Image</h3>
<p>Thunder in heaven above:
<br />
The image of The Power of the Great.
<br />
Thus the superior man does not tread upon paths
<br />
That do not accord with established order.
</p>
<h3>The Lines</h3>
<p><i>Nine at the beginning means:</i>
<br />
Power in the toes.
<br />
Continuing brings misfortune.
<br />
This is certainly true.
</p>
<p><i>Nine in the second place means:</i>
<br />
Perseverance brings good fortune.
</p>
<p><i>Nine in the third place means:</i>
<br />
The inferior man works through power.
<br />
The superior man does not act thus.
<br />
To continue is dangerous.
<br />
A goat butts against a hedge
<br />
And gets its horns entangled.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Nine in the fourth place means:</i>
<br />
Perseverance brings good fortune.
<br />
Remorse disappears.
<br />
The hedge opens; there is no entanglement.
<br />
Power depends upon the axle of a big cart.
</p>
<p><i>Six in the fifth place means:</i>
<br />
Loses the goat with ease.
<br />
No remorse.
</p>
<p><i>Six at the top means:</i>
<br />
A goat butts against a hedge.
<br />
It cannot go backward, it cannot go forward.
<br />
Nothing serves to further.
<br />
If one notes the difficulty, this brings good fortune.
</p>
