<h3>The Judgement</h3>
<p>Coming to Meet. The maiden is powerful.
<br />
One should not marry such a maiden.
</p>
<h3>The Image</h3>
<p>Under heaven, wind:
<br />
The image of Coming to Meet.
<br />
Thus does the prince act when disseminating his commands
<br />
And proclaiming them to the four quarters of heaven.
</p>
<h3>The Lines</h3>
<p class="mark"><i>Six at the beginning means:</i>
<br />
It must be checked with a brake of bronze.
<br />
Perseverance brings good fortune.
<br />
If one lets it take its course, one experiences misfortune.
<br />
Even a lean pig has it in him to rage around.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Nine in the second place means:</i>
<br />
There is a fish in the tank. No blame.
<br />
Does not further guests.
</p>
<p><i>Nine in the third place means:</i>
<br />
There is no skin on his thighs,
<br />
And walking comes hard.
<br />
If one is mindful of the danger,
<br />
No great mistake is made.
</p>
<p><i>Nine in the fourth place means:</i>
<br />
No fish in the tank.
<br />
This leads to misfortune.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Nine in the fifth place means:</i>
<br />
A melon covered with willow leaves.
<br />
Hidden lines.
<br />
Then it drops down to one from heaven.
</p>
<p><i>Nine at the top means:</i>
<br />
He comes to meet with his horns.
<br />
Humiliation. No blame.
</p>
