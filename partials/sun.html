<h3>The Judgement</h3>
<p>Decrease combined with sincerity
<br />
Brings about supreme good fortune
<br />
Without blame.
<br />
One may be persevering in this.
<br />
It furthers one to undertake something.
<br />
How is this to be carried out?
<br />
One may use two small bowls for the sacrifice.
</p>
<h3>The Image</h3>
<p>At the foot of the mountain, the lake:
<br />
The image of Decrease.
<br />
Thus the superior man controls his anger
<br />
And restrains his instincts.
</p>
<h3>The Lines</h3>
<p><i>Nine at the beginning means:</i>
<br />
Going quickly when one's tasks are finished
<br />
Is without blame.
<br />
But one must reflect on how much one may decrease others.
</p>
<p><i>Nine in the second place means:</i>
<br />
Perseverance furthers.
<br />
To undertake something brings misfortune.
<br />
Without decreasing oneself,
<br />
One is able to bring increase to others.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Six in the third place means:</i>
<br />
When three people journey together,
<br />
Their number decreases by one.
<br />
When one man journeys alone,
<br />
He finds a companion.
</p>
<p><i>Six in the fourth place means:</i>
<br />
If a man decreases his faults,
<br />
It makes the other hasten to come and rejoice.
<br />
No blame.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Six in the fifth place means:</i>
<br />
Someone does indeed increase him.
<br />
Ten pairs of tortoises cannot oppose it.
<br />
Supreme good fortune.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Nine at the top means:</i>
<br />
If one is increased without depriving others,
<br />
there is no blame.
<br />
Perseverance brings good fortune.
<br />
It furthers one to undertake something.
<br />
One obtains servants
<br />
But no longer has a separate home.
