<h3>The Judgement</h3>
<p>The Abysmal repeated.
<br />
If you are sincere, you have success in your heart,
<br />
And whatever you do succeeds.
</p>
<h3>The Image</h3>
<p>Water flows on uninterruptedly and reaches its goal:
<br />
The image of the Abysmal repeated.
<br />
Thus the superior man walks in lasting virtue
<br />
And carries on the business of teaching.
</p>
<h3>The Lines</h3>
<p><i>Six at the beginning means:</i>
<br />
Repetition of the Abysmal.
<br />
In the abyss one falls into a pit.
<br />
Misfortune.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Nine in the second place means:</i>
<br />
The abyss is dangerous.
<br />
One should strive to attain small things only.
</p>
<p><i>Six in the third place means:</i>
<br />
Forward and backward, abyss on abyss.
<br />
In danger like this, pause at first and wait,
<br />
Otherwise you will fall into a pit in the abyss.
<br />
Do not act in this way.
</p>
<p><i>Six in the fourth place means:</i>
<br />
A jug of wine, a bowl of rice with it;
<br />
Earthen vessels
<br />
Simply handed in through the window.
<br />
There is certainly no blame in this.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Nine in the fifth place means:</i>
<br />
The abyss is not filled to overflowing,
<br />
It is filled only to the rim.
<br />
No blame.
</p>
<p><i>Six at the top means:</i>
<br />
Bound with cords and ropes,
<br />
Shut in between thorn-hedged prison walls:
<br />
For three years one does not find the way.
<br />
Misfortune.
</p>
