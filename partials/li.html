<h3>The Judgement</h3>
<p>The Clinging. Perseverance furthers.
<br />
It brings success.
<br />
Care of the cow brings good fortune.
</p>
<h3>The Image</h3>
<p>That which is bright rises twice:
<br />
The image of Fire.
<br />
Thus the great man, by perpetuating this brightness,
<br />
Illumines the four quarters of the world.
</p>
<h3>The Lines</h3>
<p><i>Nine at the beginning means:</i>
<br />
The footprints run crisscross.
<br />
If one is seriously intent, no blame.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Six in the second place means:</i>
<br />
Yellow light. Supreme good fortune.
</p>
<p><i>Nine in the third place means:</i>
<br />
In the light of the setting sun,
<br />
Men either beat the pot and sing
<br />
Or loudly bewail the approach of old age.
<br />
Misfortune.
</p>
<p><i>Nine in the fourth place means:</i>
<br />
Its coming is sudden;
<br />
It flames up, dies down, is thrown away.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Six in the fifth place means:</i>
<br />
Tears in floods, sighing and lamenting.
<br />
Good fortune.
</p>
<p><i>Nine at the top means:</i>
<br />
The king uses him to march forth and chastise.
<br />
Then it is best to kill the leaders
<br />
And take captive the followers. No blame.
</p>
