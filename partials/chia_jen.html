<h3>The Judgement</h3>
<p>The Family. The perseverance of the woman furthers.
</p>
<h3>The Image</h3>
<p>Wind comes forth from fire:
<br />
The image of The Family.
<br />
Thus the superior man has substance in his words
<br />
And duration in his way of life.
</p>
<h3>The Lines</h3>

<br />
Firm seclusion within the family.
<br />
Remorse disappears.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Six in the second place means:</i>
<br />
She should not follow her whims.
<br />
She must attend within to the food.
<br />
Perseverance brings good fortune.
</p>
<p><i>Nine in the third place means:</i>
<br />
When tempers flare up in the family,
<br />
Too great severity brings remorse.
<br />
Good fortune nonetheless.
<br />
When woman and child dally and laugh,
<br />
It leads in the end to humiliation.
</p>

<br />
She is the treasure of the house.
<br />
Great good fortune.

<br />
His work commands respect.
<br />
In the end good fortune comes.
