<h3>The Judgement</h3>
<p>Dispersion. Success.
<br />
The king approaches his temple.
<br />
It furthers one to cross the great water.
<br />
Perseverance furthers.
</p>
<h3>The Image</h3>
<p>The wind drives over the water:
<br />
The image of Dispersion.
<br />
Thus the kings of old sacrificed to the Lord
<br />
And built temples.
</p>
<h3>The Lines</h3>
<p><i>Six at the beginning means:</i>
<br />
He brings help with the strength of a horse.
<br />
Good fortune.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Nine in the second place means:</i>
<br />
At the dissolution
<br />
He hurries to that which supports him.
<br />
Remorse disappears.
</p>
<p><i>Six in the third place means:</i>
<br />
He dissolves his self. No remorse.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Six in the fourth place means:</i>
<br />
He dissolves his bond with his group.
<br />
Supreme good fortune.
<br />
Dispersion leads in turn to accumulation.
<br />
This is something that ordinary men do not think of.
</p>
<p class="mark"><i>Nine in the fifth place means:</i>
<br />
His loud cries are as dissolving as sweat.
<br />
Dissolution! A king abides without blame.
</p>
<p><i>Nine at the top means:</i>
<br />
He dissolves his blood.
<br />
Departing, keeping at a distance, going out,
<br />
Is without blame.
</p>
